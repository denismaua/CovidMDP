    "# Monte Carlo Tree Search Policy Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "With the population graph and pandemic simulation models done, the Monte Carlo Tree Search method was used to estimate the best policies at each time, such that the number of hospitalized patients was never higher than the number of available hospital beds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each node of the tree contains information of a given day of the pandemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data in a node is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Population matrix: a Px4 numpy array, where P is the size of the population and each columns stores the id of the person, used to reference that person in the graph, the person current status of phase in the disease, the day at which the person was infected (used only for analysis) and the remaining time at the current state.\n",
    "\n",
    "* RSIEH: Tuple containg information regarding the total number of Recovered, Susceptible, Infected, Exposed and Hospitalized. Two nodes are considered the same if their RSIEH values are equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Policy: Current policy to be adopted by the node. All nodes are initialized with policy = 0, it policy is not given.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step Size: For how many days should the simulation run, with given policy. At the end of each day, the attributes of the node are updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Days over capacity: This attribute is initialized as 0 and for each day of the simulation, it is incremented by one if there are more hospitalized people than bed available.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Which day of the pandemic this node represents. Used only for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The reward of each node is computed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "     def getReward(self):\n",
    "        return (-np.sum(np.exp(self.cost_of_policy)) - 10e6 * self.days_over_capacity)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The tree is initialized at a root node that contains a population matrix and a day. The step size is also defined at this stage\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "current_state = treeNode(CovidState(pop_matrix, 0, step_size), None)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The tree is initialized with the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Iteration Limit: For a given steo in the simulation, how many rollouts should be carried out in total.\n",
    "* Step Size: For How long should a single policy be carried out, once chosen\n",
    "* Horizon: How many periods of lenght Step Size should be carried out in a roolut.\n",
    "* Days: Total number of days for the main simulation\n",
    "* RolloutPolicy: Which Rollout Policy Should be used.\n",

    "\n",
    "So starting at the leaf node with policy A, a simulation of time_step size is performed and at each day the values of the node are updated. Then a new child state is chosen. The new state is such that it has the same attributes as the parent state that has just been simulated and its new policy is chosen at random from all the policies that have an absolute diffence of cost of 2 units. In other words, if the parent node policy is A, the new child node will have a policy A* that satisfies \n",

    "An alternative backpropagating method was proposed, where the father the simulation is from the starting node, a degrading value is attributed to it. This was done to incentivize polcies with better rewards in the short term.\n",
